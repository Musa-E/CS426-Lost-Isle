**UNITY VERSION**: `6000.0.33f1`

# Version Info:
The black hole is still a bit finicky.  I think this is because there are a lot of calculations being made, due to the lensing effect and the number of rings I added to make it look good.   
My next commit aims to fix that by modifying the scripts used, like `SGTRing` and `SGTLens`, so hopefully the performance increases and the black holes stops flickering.
